    <!-- The Issue -->
    <div class="row" id="the_issue">
		<h1> The Issue </h1>
		<p> In June 2017, the Harvard Bussiness Review published an article analyzing how the questsions of Venture Capitalists impact the enormous gender gap in venture capital funding. By catagorizing the questions of the Venture Capitalists as </p>
		<p><b>Promotion Oriented Questions:</b> focused around hopes, acheivements and ideals; or </p>
		<p><b>Prevention Oriented Questions:</b> emphasizing responsibility, security and vigilance</p>
		<p> the reserachers determined that women were asked predominantly preventative questions whereas men were asked mostly promotional questions.</p>
		<p> Because pitchers tend to respond in the same tone in which the question was asked and groups with more promotional answers typically recieve more funding, recognizing this bias and acting against it could shift the gender gap in venture capital. There are many reasons showing why companies founded by women should get more than 2% of venture capital (2017). For example, studies have shown that organizations with female leaders have increased their incoming revenue.</p>
		<p> <b>Pitching Tone</b> aims to help Venture Capitalists recognize and break the habits that have restricted the number of innovation done by women.</p>
